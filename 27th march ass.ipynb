    "R-squared is calculated by dividing the explained variance by the total variance.

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the R-squared metric that takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. While R-squared is a measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables, adjusted R-squared provides a more conservative estimate of the model's explanatory power by adjusting for the number of predictors in the model.\n",

As the number of independent variables increases, the adjusted R-squared will decrease if the added variables do not improve the model's fit. This helps to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data and provides a more realistic estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data.\n",

A negative value of adjusted R-squared suggests that the independent variables in the model do not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable or that the model is overfitting the data. In such cases, the model may need to be revised or additional independent variables may need to be added to improve its performance."

This is because R-squared increases with the number of independent variables, even if the added variables do not significantly improve the model's fit. Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, takes into account the number of independent variables in the model and adjusts for the fact that adding more variables may not necessarily improve the model's explanatory power.\n",

    "Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when selecting the best model from a set of candidate models with different numbers of independent variables.

For example, it assumes that the independent variables are not correlated with each other, which may not always be the case. Additionally, it assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear, which may not be true in all cases. Therefore, it is important to use adjusted R-squared in conjunction with other evaluation metrics and to carefully interpret its results in the context of the specific problem being addressed."
